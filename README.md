# 🌧️ Real-Time Weather + Rain Prediction App

This Streamlit app fetches live weather data from [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/), detects current conditions, and intelligently predicts if it's likely to rain — based on:

- **Condition text** (e.g., “light rain”, “sunny”)
- **Humidity**
- **Wind speed**

Each prediction is saved daily into a CSV for analysis or future ML training.
